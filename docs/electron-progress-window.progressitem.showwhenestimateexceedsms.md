## ProgressItem.showWhenEstimateExceedsMs property

Show the progress bar when the estimated time to completion exceeds this many milliseconds. If the estimated time is less than this, the progress bar will be hidden. This is useful to hide items that complete quickly. Note that the estimate cannot be calculated until a second progress value is set (after the initial item has been created). We cannot estimate indeterminate items, so this will be ignored for those.

Default: 0 (show immediately)

**Signature:**

```typescript
get showWhenEstimateExceedsMs(): number;
```
